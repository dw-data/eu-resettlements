## Data - Resettlements

In context of EU migration policy, "resettlement" refers to relocating individuals eligible for asylum from a non-EU country (also referred to as "third country") to an EU member state. There are multiple resettlement plans as outlined in [this EU policy paper](EU-documents/20171207_resettlement_and_legal_migration_en.pdf) from December 2017.

The data on resettlements comes from various sources. The file you can download [here](data/Resettlements_50000plan.xlsx) is a summary of these sources.

Our analysis relies on information from the EU Commission's [progress report](EU-documents/20180516_progress-report-european-agenda-migration_en.pdf) published in May 2018, specifically its [Annex IV](EU-documents/20180516_annexes_progress-report-european-agenda-migration_en.pdf)

We tried to get more op to date figures by contacting individual member states, after the Commission could not provide newer numbers.

We contacted all countries that had submitted pledges.

The following countries did not reply to our request, thus we used data from the above mentioned report from May:
* Belgium
* Italy
* Lithuania
* Luxembourg
* Malta
* Netherlands
* Spain
* Cyprus
* Croatia

The following countries did provide newer figures, following our request in October 2018.
* Germany
* Sweden
* Finland
* Slovenia
* Bulgaria
* Portugal
* UK
* Romania
* Estonia
* Ireland

When confronted with our findings and asked for comment, Commission provided us with a new overall number of resettled people under the 50,000 plan, but not with a breakdown by member state. Thus, for the breakdown by country, we relied on the above mentioned information.

## Data - Illegal border crossings

Data on illegal border crossing attempts is from [Frontex](https://frontex.europa.eu/along-eu-borders/migratory-map/) and was downloaded last on November 22nd, 2018; the latest data included is from September 2018. You can download the dataset [here](data/Detections_of_IBC_2018_11_06.xlsx): In total there were 166,894 illegal border crossings from September 2017 to September 2018.
